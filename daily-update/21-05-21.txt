Worked on basic powershell scriting concepts:

Set-Location/cd		#Sets the current working location to a specified location
Get-Content/cat		#Gets the contents of a file
Clear-Content/clc	#Deletes the contents of an item, but does not delete the item
Clear-History/clear	#Clears the display in the host program
Get-History		#Gets a list of the commands entered during the current session
Get-Command		#Gets all commands
Get-Alias		#Gets all aliases 
help			#Displays information about Windows PowerShell commands and concepts
mkdir			#Creates a new item
Rename-Item		#Renames an item in a Windows PowerShell provider namespace
Remove-Item		#Deletes files and folders
