Worked on basic git concepts such as initialization, clone, add, commit, push and pull:

git init				#initialization if Git repository
git clone <url>				#cloning
git add <file-name>			#adding files to the git repo
git commit -m "message"			#commiting files to the repo
git push				#pusing files to thwe repo
git pull


Worked on branching and merging and deleting conceps in Git:

git checkout -b <branch-name>		#creating and checkout to that new branch
git branch				#check the branches and to locate current branch
git push -u origin <file-name>		#pushing the branch to the repo
git checkout <branch-name>		#to navigate between the branches
git merge <branch-name>			#merge new branch to main branch
git checkout -d <branch-name>		#delete the branch
